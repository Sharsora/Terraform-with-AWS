### What is Infrastructure as Code?
- Provisioning your infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.

### Why Infrastructure as Code?
- Consistency: Identical environments across dev, staging, and production
- Time Efficiency: Automated provisioning saves hours of manual work
- Cost Management: Easy to track costs and automate cleanup
- Scalability: Deploy to hundreds of servers with same effort as one
- Version Control: Track changes in Git
- Reduced Human Error: Eliminate manual configuration mistakes
- Collaboration: Team can work together on infrastructure
### Benefits of IaC
- Consistent environment deployment
- Easy to track and manage costs
- Write once, deploy many (single codebase)
- Time-saving automation
- Reduced human error
- Cost optimization through automation
- Version control for infrastructure changes
- Automated cleanup and scheduled destruction
- Developer focus on application development
- Easy creation of identical production environments for troubleshooting
### What is Terraform?
- Infrastructure as Code tool that helps automate infrastructure provisioning and management across multiple cloud providers.

### How Terraform Works
- Write Terraform files → Run Terraform commands → Call AWS APIs through Terraform Provider

### Terraform Workflow Phases:

```terraform init - Initialize the working directory
terraform validate - Validate the configuration files
terraform plan - Create an execution plan
terraform apply - Apply the changes to reach desired state
terraform destroy - Destroy the infrastructure when needed```
